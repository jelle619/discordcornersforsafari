# Discord Corners for Safari (and other browsers)

This project is based off [NNTin's work](https://github.com/NNTin/discord-logo) for his Animated Discord Logo project. This modified version fixes the compatibility issues with Safari. Without this fix, the Discord logo will not appear and it might not bring you to the desired URL.
